# Art Institute of Chicago Browser Extension

> A browser extension that presents a random work of art from the Art Institute of Chicago's collection with each new tab.

In September 2019, the Art Institute of Chicago (AIC) launched its data API for public use. The API provides information and access to over 100,000 artworks.

Using the data API and [IIIF's image API](https://iiif.io), AIC's browser extension presents an artwork from the museum's collection in your browser every time a new tab is opened. The extension focuses on selecting from over 50,000 works marked for [public domain](https://www.artic.edu/image-licensing) use.

For public use, this extension is available in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/art-institute-of-chicago/abacageipbknolldcoehafgfjamoejad). If you'd like to install the plugin for local development, follow the instructions below.

This repo serves as an example of using the Art Institute of Chicago's data API.

## Configuration

In [script.js](script.js), you'll find the query that fetches a random artwork:

```
let timeStamp = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);
    let artworkRequest = {
        "resources": "artworks",
        "fields": [
            "id",
            "title",
            "artist_title",
            "image_id",
            "date_display",
	    "thumbnail"
        ],
        "boost": false,
        "limit": 1,
        "query": {
            "function_score": {
                "query": {
                    "bool": {
                            "must": [
                                {
                                    "term": {
                                        "is_public_domain": true
                                    },
                                },
                                {
                                    "exists": {
                                        "field": "image_id",
                                    },
                                },
                            ],
                        },

                    "seed": timeStamp
                }
            }
        }
    };

```bash
# Clone the repo to your computer
git clone git@github.com:your-github-account/browser-extension.git

# Enter the folder that was created by the clone
cd browser-extension

# Install dependencies (we use Yarn)
yarn install --frozen-lockfile

# Start a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/good-short-description

# ... make some changes, commit your code

# Push your branch to GitHub
git push origin feature/good-short-description
```

This project is released with a Contributor Code of Conduct. By participating in
this project you agree to abide by its [terms](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

We welcome bug reports and questions under GitHub's [Issues](issues). For other concerns, you can reach our engineering team at [engineering@artic.edu](mailto:engineering@artic.edu)

### Code Formatting

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to perform standard formatting across
all the JS, CSS, HTML, and Markdown files in the project. If you've installed
the project dependencies correctly with Yarn, a pre-commit hook that formats all
your staged files _should_ automatically execute when you run `git commit`.

Alternatively, you could manually run Prettier like so:

```bash
yarn prettier --write "$(pwd)/**/*.(js|css|html|md)
```
